# fraxton-compiler


### What is fraxton?
> Fraxton is a language created as an experiment. It is not intended to be powerful or speedy.
> I have only created it to learn more about languages and compilers.


#### How is it intended to function?
> Fraxton should compile down to C++ code
> In the future, it might compile to Assembly (once I have the skills to do so)



#### Can I use this compiler?
> Not yet.
> Only *part* of the lexer is functional for now....


#### When will it be available to use?
> As soon as I get it working!  
> No release date is scheduled as I am learning every step of the way.  
> If you would want to collaborate, feel free!
